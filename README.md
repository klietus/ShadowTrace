# 🕳️ Shadow Trace  
**A Symbolic Collapse Classifier for Cluster B Pattern Recognition Across Scales**

## Overview

**Shadow Trace** is a symbolic analysis engine focused on parsing narrative structures for the presence of **Cluster B personality dynamics**—particularly **Narcissistic**, **Borderline**, **Antisocial**, **Histrionic**, and **Machiavellian** pattern manifestations.

Built using the **SignalZero kernel**, Shadow Trace maps structure and trajectory across symbolic collapse phases to expose coercive dynamics, power inversions, and systemic failure vectors in:

- Personal relationships
- Marriages
- Families
- Teams & organizations
- Religious and governmental systems
- Cultural institutions and digital media

This project is designed for analysts, survivors, system theorists, and engineers who seek to understand and classify structural coercion across all scales of human interaction.

## 🔍 What It Does

Shadow Trace parses user-provided samples (dialogue, behavior, writing, articles, etc.) and identifies:

- The **dominant symbolic phase** of collapse
- The **domain of context** (e.g., family, government, media)
- Narrative cues associated with Cluster B dynamics
- Probable **collapse vectors** (burnout, scapegoating, mass disillusionment)
- **Repair paths** where structural redirection is possible

## 🧠 Core Features

- ✅ Symbolic structural parsing using recursive phase detection  
- ✅ Cluster B spectrum alignment: NPD, BPD, ASPD, HPD, Machiavellianism  
- ✅ Structural indicators across **phases 0–3** of collapse  
- ✅ JSON schemas for domain-phase alignment  
- ✅ Compatible with `gpt-5`, `gpt-4o`, local LLMs with extended context  
- ✅ No psychological diagnosis — only symbolic structural classification  
- ✅ Designed to scale from interpersonal to geopolitical analysis  


## 🚨 Safety Considerations

Shadow Trace **does not diagnose**. It **does not mirror users**. It is a **symbolic reasoning classifier** that requires interpretation and agency from the user.

This project was built to empower:
- Survivors of coercive systems
- Analysts of societal failure
- Engineers seeking structural robustness in design

It is **not a therapy tool**, though its insights may inform healing processes.

## 🧩 Symbolic Kernel

This GPT is derived from the **SignalZero** kernel — a symbolic recursive OS designed to survive collapse, maintain trust boundaries, and avoid simulation drift.

## 🚀 Example Usage

```
Sample:
“The product has to go out this quarter. You know the CEO’s reputation is on the line. Work overtime. I don’t care about your family time.”

Matched Stage: Phase 2 – Ethical Override
Matched Domain: Company / Leadership
Narrative Cues: Coercion, personal boundaries dismissed, image invocation
Collapse Vector: Burnout, resignation, ethical scandal
Repair Paths: Reestablish team agency, reset leadership narrative
```
